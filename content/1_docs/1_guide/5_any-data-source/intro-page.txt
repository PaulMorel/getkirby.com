Title: Virtual pages

----

Description: In Kirby, you can integrate data from any data source and use them as if they were real Kirby pages, including creating and editing their content in the Panel.

Since Kirby is a flat-file CMS, pages that make up your website usually exist as files and folders in the filesystem. This has many advantages: your web project can be version controlled, you don't have to deal with a database, it's easy to make backups, you can manually edit your content if you want, and last not least, it's also very fast. At least up to a certain point where it doesn't scale too well any more.

From the early days of Kirby, it was possible to include data from other sources into your Kirby-built website. But with our new architecture, you can really integrate content from any sources–from databases, from external APIs, or Excel sheets–you name them.

You can swap out Kirby's storage mechanism on a per-model basis, just like you can replace almost any Kirby component, allowing you to flexibly combine all sorts of data sources.

This section will give you an overview about all the possibilites Kirby offers.

Virtual pages can be used to just consume content from other sources, for example, from a read-only API. Or you can actually create adaptors to read from and write to database tables, spreadsheets or whatever.

We refer to anything that does not exists as folders and files as "virtual pages".
